# PySTT (PySpeechToText)

PySTT is an offline and online real-time speech-to-text tool supporting both **Vosk** (offline) and **Google Speech Recognition** (online) engines.  
It transcribes spoken words seamlessly with live keyboard control to delete or save transcriptions.

# Installation and Usage

First, make sure you have Python installed. Then install dependencies by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you're going to use "Offline" you need to download the Vosk offline model (e.g. [vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)) and extract it.  
Place the model folder in the same directory as the script or update the `MODEL_PATH` in the script accordingly.

Run the script with:

    py main.py


### Controls:
- **Speak** to transcribe text live.
- **Backspace** to delete the last spoken word.
- **Enter** to save the transcription to `speech_output.txt` and exit.

**Tested On Python 3.10+**
