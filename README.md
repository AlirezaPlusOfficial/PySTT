# PySTT
PySTT (PySpeechToText) is a project that enables real-time speech-to-text conversion using both Google Speech Recognition (online) and Vosk (offline) speech recognition engines. It allows users to transcribe spoken words into text seamlessly and efficiently, supporting both cloud-based and fully offline transcription options for greater flexibility and privacy.
